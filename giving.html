	<li>In 1994 <a href="{{ site.rooturl }}/research_room">Marcia Brown</a> named the Department as the repository of her 
	  life's work, including her correspondence, manuscripts, drawings, final art, books, and puppets.
	  As part of that gift, Ms. Brown established a fund to aid in processing and preserving her collection with a $10,000 donation. Over time Ms. Brown continued to give generously. After her death in 2015, her estate established the Marcia Brown Endowment to ensure the continual support of the University Libraries and the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives.The Department's research room was officially designated the Marcia Brown Research Room on November 2, 2001, to honor Ms. Brown's intellectual and financial support.</li></ul>
