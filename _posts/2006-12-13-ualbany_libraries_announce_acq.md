<p>From the press release available in PDF format <a href="http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/Syracuseacq.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The University at Albany's Libraries have added another, varied collection of political papers to its important archive, <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/browse/apap.html">New York State Modern Political Archive</a>.</p>
<p>The collection, received from Syracuse University Libraries, includes the papers from 22 former new York Congressional members and 41 legislators who served in the New York State Legislature. This acquisition was completed to strengthen scholarly research and to support the long-term preservation and access to New York's political history by placing the materials at the University at Albany Libraries' premier political archive, which includes more than 300 collections from advocacy groups, poliitcal activists, and legislators integral to New York State's public policy.</p>
<p>According to Brian Keough, head of the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, "The continued development of the New York State Modern Political Archive will better serve scholars and students of modern political history by making accessible a comprehensive archive available in one centralized location."</p>
<p>A celebration of the collection as well as to honor donors will be held in April 2007. Contact Brian Keough for detailed information: 518-437-3931 or <a href="mailto:bkeough@uamail.albany.edu">bkeough@uamail.albany.edu</a>.</p>
