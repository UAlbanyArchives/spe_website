 <p>Initially, I thought the best way around this issue was to create an image of my own, a symbol composed of three circles or a spiral with three sections that would encapsulate the contents of the collection under three key themes. The circles were composed in Bootstrap, but the idea was doomed to fail as I was working too broadly. I had neither the subject knowledge nor the interest to summarize the collection in its entirety, and even if I did, it would not result in an engaging exhibit. Moreover, I was imposing my ideas on the collection, instead of becoming familiar with the collection’s unique merits. A second look at the collection’s finding aid revealed the New York State Society for Clinical Social Work (NYSSCSW) routinely published a newsletter most recently called The Clinician and had been doing so since the mid-1970s.
