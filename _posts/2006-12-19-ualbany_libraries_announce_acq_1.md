<p>ALBANY, NY (December 19, 2006)--The University at Albanyâ€™s Libraries have acquired the papers of U.S. Congressman Sherwood Boehlert (R-24th  District).  Mr. Boehlert recently retired, after serving in the U.S. Congress since first elected in 1982.</p>
<p>Congressman Boehlertâ€™s papers will add significantly to UAlbanyâ€™s <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/browse/apap.html">New York State Modern Political Archive</a>. His papers include approximately 500 boxes, and stand as record of a long and productive career serving the people of New York.  Among Mr. Boehlertâ€™s many achievements was his chairmanship of the House Science Committee; he also served on committees on Transportation and Infrastructure. By appointment of the Speaker of the House, Congressman Boehlert served for eight years as a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he was on the front line of important intelligence decisions faced by Congress. Early in 2003, the Speaker appointed Boehlert to serve on the newly created Select Committee on Homeland Security.</p>
<p>In addition to being a leader on science issues, Boehlertâ€™s legislative experience and seniority made him one of the most influential Members of Congress. National Journal featured him as one of a dozen "key players" in the House. Time Magazine highlighted Congressman Boehlert as a power center on Capitol Hill. Congressional Quarterly regularly named Boehlert  one of the 50 most effective lawmakers in Washington.</p>
