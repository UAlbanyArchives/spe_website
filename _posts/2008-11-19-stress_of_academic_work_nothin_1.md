<p>While writing those end of semester papers and preparing for finals current students might find some truth in Carrie J. Goddardâ€™s 1894 notes on Professor James Wetmore's class in Sanitary Science at the New York State Normal College (reproduced below).  The title of the lecture, or at least of Goddardâ€™s notes on the lecture, was â€œDangers of School Life to the Brain.â€?   According to Goddardâ€™s notes below, Wetmore told the class that â€œimpure air, over study, examinations, punishmentsâ€? could lead to diseases of the brain such as â€œSt. Vitasâ€™ Dance, epilepsy, brain fever, [or] nervous prostration,â€? or simply to â€œinsanity.â€?  </p>
