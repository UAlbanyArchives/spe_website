<p>While writing those end of semester papers and preparing for finals current students might find some truth in Carrie J. Goddard's 1894 notes on Professor James Wetmore's class in Sanitary Science at the New York State Normal College (reproduced below).  The title of the lecture, or at least of Goddard's notes on the lecture, was "Dangers of School Life to the Brain."   According to Goddard's notes below, Wetmore told the class that "impure air, over study, examinations, punishments" could lead to diseases of the brain such as "St. Vitas' Dance, epilepsy, brain fever, [or] nervous prostration," or simply to "insanity."  </p>
