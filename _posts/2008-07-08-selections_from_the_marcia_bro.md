<p>The cover of the November 1939 issue of <em>The Statesman</em> (right) was illustrated by Marcia Brown, class of 1940, New York State College for Teachers (NYSCT), whose career in the field of childrenâ€™s literature is one of great distinction.  While at NYSCT, her writing and artistic abilities blossomed, as she contributed to the school's literary and humor magazines. <br/>

Her sketches of mice, lions and other illustrations can be seen in the pages of these publications which are preserved at the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives. These early illustrations provide a strong indication of Brownâ€™s future abilities as an illustrator and author, a career that includes being honored as the only three-time Caldecott Medal winner and six-time Caldecott Honor. <br/>

One can follow all the steps in creating an original piece of literature and art from early notes and sketches through the final artwork and the proof sheets and printing to the promotional material and reviews.  </p>
