<div class="entry-body">
<p>The M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives is pleased to announce the online availability of the University at Albanyâ€™s student newspaper from 1916-1985. You can browse each issue from the<em> State College News</em>, 1916-1963, <em>State University News</em>,  1963-1964, and the <em>Albany Student Press (ASP)</em>, 1964-1985. The <em>ASP</em> , 1986 - 2009, and <em>The Echo</em>, 1892-1916, are available in hard copy at the Special Collections' Marcia Brown Reading Room. Issues are available at:<a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ua809"> http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/studentnewspapers.htm</a></p>
<p>Support for this digital project came from the Friends of the Libraries and would not have been possible without their assistance. In collaboration with the Library Systems Department, we are developing a full text database of the newspaper that will allow searching across multiple issues, years, or decades. In addition, the Department of Special Collections will develop a plan to digitize the <em>ASP</em>,1986 -2009, and <em>The Echo</em>, 1892-1916, a student news and literary magazine.<br/>
