---
<div class="entry-body">
<p>The <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/browse/91.html">National Death Penalty Archive</a> in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives continues to expand. Last month, over 80 cubic feet of records from Abe Bonowitz, Bill Pelke, Bill Babbitt, and Michael Mello were transferred to the Department of Special Collections and Archives. Bonowitz of <a href="http://www.cuadp.org/">Citizens United for Alternatives to the Death Penalty</a> and <a href="http://www.njadp.org/">New Jerseyans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty</a>, Pelke of <a href="http://www.journeyofhope.org/">Journey of Hope...From Violence to Healing</a>, and Charlie Lanier of the <a href="http://www.albany.edu/scj/cpri.htm">Capital Punishment Research Initiative</a> even braved one of the hottest days of the summer in August to bring more records to UAlbany! You can read Abe's account of the trip and his encouragement to others to consider transferring their records to the National Death Penalty Archive <a href="http://www.cuadp.org/abolition_archives.html">here</a>.</p>
