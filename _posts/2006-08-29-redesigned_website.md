<p>The Department of Special Collections and Archives' website has undergone a gradual redesign in recent months. A few things you may have noticed: <br/>
&gt;&gt;Individual pages have been redesigned in an effort to make them easier to navigate by adding menus.<br/>
&gt;&gt;The <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ger013">finding aids</a> were given a new Department logo graphic.<br/>
&gt;&gt;The Department's <a href="{{ site.url }}/collections">second level pages</a> (everything other than <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ger013">finding aids</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/exhibits">exhibits</a>, and the Department's <a href="https://archives.albany.edu">index page</a>) also have a new logo featuring <a href="http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/imageheader.htm">images from our collections</a>.</p>
<p>The Department's website will continue to change and we welcome your input and suggestions.</p>
