<p>Greetings from the University Libraries! Hi my name is Mark Wolfe and I work in the Department of Special Collections and Archives that's actually located in the Science Library.</p>

<p>While we wait for the coast to clear again to resume our normal lives, the librarians and archivists are all still here working, but instead of face to face we're helping you online. We can assist you with research projects using historical resources such as digitized photos, digitized audio and video, and digitized documents newspapers, and books.</p>

<p>All of these resources that are online are historical in nature. If you're interested in these, you can go to our website, the archives website, which is <a href="https://archives.albany.edu">https://archives.albany.edu</a>. When you get to that website all you have to do is click on a contact button and you'll be led to a form that you fill out with your question or what interest you have in historical resources at the archives.</p>

<p>We are all wishing you a safe and sane semester and all the best from the University Libraries.</p>
