<p>ALBANY, N.Y. (April 30, 2019) - The University Libraries at the University at Albany, SUNY today presented the 2019 Patricia Stocking Brown Research Awards to University at Albany graduate student <strong>Elizabeth Horning</strong> and undergraduate student <strong>Joshua Levine</strong>.</p>
<p><br/>
A first year doctoral student in the Department of Educational Policy and Leadership, School of Education, Ms. Horning received $500 for her research on Dr. Alice Green.  This project, initially created by Ms. Horning for her senior Capstone project in History under the supervision of Dr. Laura Wittern-Keller, examines the interdisciplinary education of the Albany-based, social justice advocate Dr. Green and her professional activism.  As a graduate student, Ms. Horning is revising this project for publication and presentation opportunities and potentially expanding it to include other contemporaneous New York activists with education backgrounds. </p>
