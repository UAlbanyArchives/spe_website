<p>The exhibit <em><a href="https://archives.albany.edu/static/exhibits/secretlives/index.htm">The Secret Lives of Toys and Their Friends</a></em> is on display in the lobby of the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives on the third floor of the Science Library at the University at Albany. <br/>
A small number of items and information from the exhibit are made available online at <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/static/exhibits/secretlives/index.htm">http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/secretlives/</a> as an introduction to the physical exhibit.<br/>
This exhibit contains items drawn from The Miriam Snow Mathes Historical Childrenâ€™s Literature Collection and is on exhibit through early October 2006. This exhibit features a small sampling of the many stories written for children from either a toyâ€™s point of view or about adventures based on the lives of living toys or objects. The over fifty items in the physical exhibit, including the small number displayed in the online exhibit, are a fraction of what the Mathes Collection contains on the subject of animated objects and/or toys.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <em><a href="https://archives.albany.edu/static/exhibits/secretlives/index.htm">The Secret Lives of Toys and Their Friends</a></em> is back by popular demand on display in the lobby of the Department of Special Collections and Archives beginning January 24, 2007.</p>
