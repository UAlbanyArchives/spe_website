<p>Over 1,000 publications and 4,000 photographs from the records of the Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA), United University Professions, and IUE-CWA (International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers) Local 301 were recently made available online.<br/>
<br/>
The digitization of the Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) newsletters was begun with the support of CSEA with issues of The Civil Service Leader from the years 1946-1947 and 1950-1953 currently available in PDF format through the finding aid for the collection, which is available at <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap015">http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/apap015.htm</a>. The digitization of the CSEAâ€™s newsletters is an ongoing project and eventually issues from 1944-1989 of The Civil Service Leader and its successor The Public Sector will be available online. Also, over 700 images documenting labor from the early 20th century to the present from the records of CSEA are also available online. A link to the CSEA images in the University at Albany Librariesâ€™ Digital Collections database is also available at <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap015">http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/apap015.htm</a>. The Civil Service Employees Association, Inc., or CSEA, is the largest public employees' union in New York State with over 260,000 members. CSEA began in Albany, New York, in 1910 as a collective effort by a handful of state employees to earn better wages and working conditions.<br/>

Over 4,000 images from the records of United University Professions (UUP) are also available online thanks to the support of UUP. A link to the UUP images in the University at Albany Librariesâ€™ Digital Collections database is available at <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap039">http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/apap039.htm</a>.
