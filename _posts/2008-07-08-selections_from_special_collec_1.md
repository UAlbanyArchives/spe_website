<p>The cover of the November 1939 issue of The Statesman (right) was illustrated by Marcia Brown, class of 1940, New York State College for Teachers (NYSCT), whose career in the field of children' literature is one of great distinction.  While at NYSCT, her writing and artistic abilities blossomed, as she contributed to the school's literary and humor magazines. <br/>

Her sketches of mice, lions and other illustrations can be seen in the pages of these publications (excerpts below) which are preserved at the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives. These early illustrations provide a strong indication of Brown' future abilities as an illustrator and author, a career that includes being honored as the only three-time Caldecott Medal winner and six-time Caldecott Honor. <br/>
