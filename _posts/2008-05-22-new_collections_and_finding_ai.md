<a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap241"><strong>Congressman James J. Delaney Papers</strong></a><br/>
Elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-ninth United States Congress in November 1944, Delaney was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1946. Delaneyâ€™s hiatus from politics was short-lived as he was elected again in November 1948 and remained in Congress until his retirement in December 1978. The James Joseph Delaney Papers cover the years 1950-1978, and document Delaneyâ€™s extensive tenure in Congress.  Delaney served as Congressman from Queens, New York and his three decades in Washington are distinguished by consecutive elections to chairman of the House Rules Committee and the addition of the Delaney Clause to the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Papers contain 12 cubic feet of legislative files, correspondence, reports, speeches, statements, press releases, and news clippings.  </p>

In 1989, Tracy Frisch, an etymologist who had suffered from pesticide poisoning, formed a non-profit citizens' organization committed to reducing hazardous chemical pesticides use through education and advocacy called the New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides (NYCAP). This collection documents the activities of the New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides (NYCAP) from its creation in 1989 through 2002. The organization was formed as a not-for-profit group devoted to educating the public about pesticide and other environmental dangers. The organization was able to spread their message through conferences, workshops, mail order catalogs, information requests, school programs, and policy-making. This collection also documents the professional career of Tracy Frisch in the decade before her founding of NYCAP. Material from her career as a New York State Legislature lobbyist and staff member is included in this collection as well as materials from her research on environmental pests and pollution from the early 1980s. </p>
