<p>Ms. Casseus, who just received her Master of Arts degree, with a concentration in History and Media, was awarded $500 for her ongoing project to create a 15 minute documentary about United Tenants of Albany, an area housing advocacy group.  Professor Gerald Zahavi of the Department of History serves as faculty advisor to the project, which uses the United Tenants of Albany as a case study to examine the disproportionate impact of a lack of affordable housing on low income women. <br/>
