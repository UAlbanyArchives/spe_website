<p>The Department has created an account over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grenander/">Flickr</a> for sharing images from current events and programs. All images from the Department's collections that are available in digital form will continue to be available only in the <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/catalog?f[resource_type_sim][]=Image">University at Albany Libraries' Digital Collections</a> database, so if you are looking for images from your commencement in 1975 you won't find them at the Flickr page.</p>
