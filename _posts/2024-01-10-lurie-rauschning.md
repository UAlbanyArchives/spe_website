<p>Last year, during my first semester working as a Graduate Student Assistant at the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, I processed the Hermann Rauschning Papers, 1930-1980. This was an exciting project for me to work on because of my knowledge of German. I studied German language from sixth grade, through high school and then my undergraduate studies. My passion for German language and culture comes from my dad; he was stationed in Germany during his time in the U.S. Army. Inspired by my dad, I continue to study German language, both spoken and written, in my free time. Along with being a graduate assistant at the M.E. Grenander Department, I am enrolled in the dual degree MA in history/MS in information science (Archives and Records Management concentration) at the University at Albany. The overlap between the two programs really allows for professional students to expand on the skills from both programs. From my perspective, I have been able to apply my knowledge of history to archival practices.</p>

<p>Rauschning (1887-1982) was a German author and politician, who served as the President of the <em>Freie Stadt Danzig</em>, or the Free City of Danzig from June 1933-November 1934. Danzig was a city state, established as a self-governing power in 1920, as a breakaway from the German Empire. During the rise of the Nazi movement, Rauschning was initially a member, but broke from the party in 1934, and emigrated from Germany in 1936. As a political émigré, Rauschning settled in the United States and authored a variety of political works on Germany. For more information on Rauschning, please refer to our finding aid for his <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/ger076?find=hermann%20rauschning" target="_blank">collection </a>.

 The collection contains a variety of materials in German, English, and French; correspondence and publications authored by Rauschning comprise the bulk of the papers. Correspondence with other German émigrés, such as Golo Mann (1909-1994) and Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (1888-1973) is included. </p>
<p>Besides being able to apply my knowledge of German to processing, arranging and describing the collection, I also enjoyed applying my research skills in history to find biographical information about Rauschning. Understanding the context of the record creator and how their life experiences shaped their work, and how their life fit into a historical narrative, allows for the materials in a collection to be better represented. Rauschning’s background as an émigré and a conservative politician, who attempted to represent the complex identity of the German nation during the 20th century connects all of the materials. Understanding both German and English, the predominant languages in the Rauschning Papers, allows me to have a unique perspective on how German and American audiences perceived the issues Rauschning discussed. A bilingual approach also encourages a unique comparative examination and can promote a deeper understanding of cultures and customs. When studying the rise of Nazi Germany, it is important to compare different perspectives, particularly amongst the German people and German diaspora. </p>
