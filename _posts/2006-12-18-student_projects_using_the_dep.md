title: Student Projects Using the Department and Collections
---
<div class="entry-body">
<p>Every year hundreds of students from the University at Albany and other institutions from around the world use the Department of Special Collections and Archives' collections. Most of these uses are thought of as fairly traditional-theses, dissertations, papers, oral history interviews, an occasional exhibit, etc. A couple graduate students happened to send me links to their projects over the weekend that used the Department or its collections in some way this semester and I thought I would share them here. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.albany.edu/~jr632897/ist659/page4.html">"The Journey of a Curious Doll"</a> was created by Jenn Russell as part of her IST 659: Digital Imaging &amp; Web course. (It isn't displaying properly for me using Mozilla Firefox, so take a look using IE or another browser.) Jenn's project used the Department exhibit <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/static/exhibits/secretlives/index.htm">"The Secret Lives of Toys and Their Friends,"</a> as well as the entire Main Campus, as its setting and you will note that a few of the books from the exhibit are featured. Please note that I will not be letting every doll that asks spend time in our exhibit cases.</p>
<p>One of Charles Schlesinger's postings at his <a href="http://www.albany.edu/~cs2160/blog/2006/10/page-4-libraries-digitizing-future.html">blog</a> includes images from equipment and collections in the Department of Special Collections and Archives as well as our neighbor here on the third floor of the Science Library, the Preservation Department.</p>
