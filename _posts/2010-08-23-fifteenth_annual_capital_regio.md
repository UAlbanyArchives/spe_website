<div class="entry-body">
<p>The Capital Region Archives Dinner Committee, in co-operation with the Archives Partnership Trust and the Capital Area Archivists, is proud to present the Fifteenth Annual Capital Region Archives Dinner at the Edison Club in Rexford, NY on Wednesday, October 6, 2010. The evening begins with a cash bar &amp; hors dâ€™oeuvres at 6:00 pm and the dinner and program at 7:00 pm. </p>
<p>The keynote speaker is Dr. Gerald Zahavi, professor of History and Director of the Documentary Studies Program at the University at Albany, State University of New York, and noted expert on the history of General Electric.  Focusing on an important aspect of GEâ€™s social life, Association Island, a corporate summer recreation retreat and conference center owned by GE for half a century, Dr. Zahavi will explore the usefulness of utilizing non-textual sources to interpret the often hidden social and cultural dimensions of economic history and demonstrate the value of expanding archival collections in business history far beyond the traditional printed and written sources.</p>
