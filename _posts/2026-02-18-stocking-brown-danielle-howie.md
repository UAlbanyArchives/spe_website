 <p>The University Libraries at the University at Albany, SUNY announced the 2025 Patricia Stocking Brown Research Award recipient is University at Albany undergraduate student Danielle Howie.</p>
 <p>A member of the Class of 2025, Ms. Howie was a History honors and Psychology major, Ms. Howie received $250 for her research studying women’s environmental activism that centered advocacy around motherhood and domestic responsibility highlighting both the constraints and opportunities these roles presented. Ms. Howie reviewed the Hope Donovon Papers and Jeanne Casatelli Papers that blend traditional maternalistic activism and the broader struggle for gender equity in political and public spheres. Professor Hochfelder served as the project advisor. Ms. Howie received her Bachelor of Arts degree and entered the graduate History program at the University in fall 2025.</p>
 <p>The annual Award honors Professor Patricia Stocking Brown, who taught Biology and Women’s and Minorities’ Studies for 35 years at nearby Siena College. Trained at the University of Michigan in comparative endocrinology, and a self-described feminist, Patricia Stocking Brown was the first female faculty member in the sciences at Siena. There she established an extraordinary career as a caring and rigorous teacher and researcher who promoted student research, feminist analytical thinking, and evidence-based medicine. Brown was the wife of University at Albany Distinguished Teaching Professor of Biology Emeritus Stephen C. Brown.</p>
<p>Professor Patricia Stocking Brown died in 2004 from metastatic breast cancer. The University at Albany Libraries’ Department of Special Collections & Archives holds Brown’s papers along with those of the grassroots nonprofit Capital Region Action Against Breast Cancer (CRAAB!), which she co-founded in 1997, and the New York State Breast Cancer Network, a coalition of grassroots breast cancer groups around the state, she co-founded soon after.</p>
