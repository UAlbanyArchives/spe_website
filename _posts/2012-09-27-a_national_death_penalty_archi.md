<p>The University at Albany's School of Criminal Justice and the University Libraries are proud to host former Dean and Professor Emeritus Victor Streib, of the Ohio Northern University College of Law, who will offer remarks in connection with the announcement of the addition of his papers to the National Death Penalty Archive (NDPA).  Dean Streib is recognized as the country's foremost authority on the capital punishment of juveniles and women.  His work has been cited extensively by the United States Supreme Court in its cases addressing the constitutionality of the death penalty for juvenile offenders.  His remarks will address "Death to the Women and Children," and will analyze national and international trends regarding the capital punishment of these different populations.  Discussion, an opportunity for questions, and a reception will follow.  Portions of the materials that Dean Streib has donated to the NDPA will be on display.  The program is free and open to the public.  For a copy of the latest edition of Dean Streib's research report, <em><strong>Death Penalty for Female Offenders</strong></em>, visit: <a href="http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FemDeathDec2011.pdf">http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FemDeathDec2011.pdf</a><br/>
