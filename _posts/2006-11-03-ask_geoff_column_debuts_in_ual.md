<p>The Fall 2006 issue of <em>UAlbany Magazine</em> includes the new column <strong>"Ask Geoff"</strong> from University Archivist Geoffrey Williams. In the first column "Ask Geoff" answers questions about the number of names the University at Albany has had over its history, what a normal school is, and whether the downtown campus was the school's first location.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The latest issue of <em>UAlbany Magazine</em> is now <a href="http://www.albany.edu/docs/pr/magazinenew.shtml">online</a>.</p>
<p>Geoff Williams is a graduate of Colby College and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and joined the faculty of the University at Albany as University Archivist in 1987. Additional information about the <a href="{{ site.url }}/ua">University Archives</a> is available online and by asking Geoff!</p>
<p>Geoff will be responding to questions alumni, students, and friends pose about the University at Albany. To submit a question for "Ask Geoff," e-mail <a href="mailto:gwilliams@uamail.albany.edu">gwilliams@uamail.albany.edu</a>.</p>
