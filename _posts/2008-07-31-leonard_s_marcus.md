<p><img align="left" alt="cover copy.jpg" height="280" hspace="2" src="{{ site.url }}/posts-img/cover%20copy.jpg" vspace="2" width="190"> Leonard Marcus, one of the foremost authorities on the history of childrenâ€™s literature, will discuss and sign his new book,  Minders of Make-Believe (2008, Houghton Mifflin), an animated first-time history of the visionary editors, authors, librarians, booksellers, and others whose passion for books has transformed American childhood and American culture. </img></p>
<p>What should children read? Marcus tackles this three-hundred-year-old question that sparked the creation of a rambunctious childrenâ€™s book publishing scene in Colonial times. And itâ€™s the urgent issue that went on to fuel the transformation of twentieth-century childrenâ€™s book publishing from a genteel backwater to big business. Marcus delivers a provocative look at the fierce turf wars fought among pioneering editors, progressive educators, and librarians - most of them women - throughout the twentieth century. His story of the emergence and growth of the major publishing houses - and of the distinctive literature for the young they shaped - gains extraordinary depth through the authorâ€™s path-finding research and in-depth interviews with dozens of editors, artists, and other key publishing figures whose careers go back to the 1930s. <br/>
