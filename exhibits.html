<!--Edward Durrell Stone-->	
<p><em><a href="https://archives.albany.edu/static/exhibits/stone/index.htm"> Edward Durell Stone and the Building of the Uptown Campus, 1961-1971:</a></em> (University Library August-December 2006, Science Library January 2007-) On display near the entrance of the University Library are items drawn from the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives&#39; University Archives and book collections about the Edward Durell Stone designed Uptown Campus of the University at Albany, SUNY. The Uptown Campus was constructed between 1961 and 1971 on the former rolling hills of the Albany Country Club and the first classes were held on the Academic Podium in the fall 1966. Envisioning the Podium as the center of the Academy, Stone&rsquo;s result has had considerable success. From the late 1960s to today the Podium has been the favored site for political demonstrations, informal student activities, and official events such as the Candlelight Ceremony to welcome freshman, and Torch Night to celebrate seniors&rsquo; transition to Alumni/ae. Stone&rsquo;s buildings can be found from New York to Chicago to San Diego and from Peru to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. They span the gamut from private homes, museums, government buildings and factories to cultural centers, hospitals, religious structures, theaters, housing and hotels. All share a similar architectural style. This exhibit is curated by Geoffrey P. Williams, University Archivist. It will be on display in the University Library through December 2006 and an expanded version will be unveiled in January 2007 in the Science Library.</p>
