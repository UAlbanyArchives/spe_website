<br />Introduction</h4>
<p><a href="#table">Back to table of contents</a>
<p>Processing manuscript collections involves a number of procedures and decisions 
that require careful thought and consideration.  Some of the more important areas 
for consideration include the provenance or original order of the collection, a 
preliminary screening or inventory, and the actual processing procedures.  The 
following guidelines and suggestions are not steadfast rules.  The exceptions to 
these rules are what make the processing of manuscript and archival collections 
more than a simple clerical task.</p>
<p>Once a donor has agreed to deposit their records and an appraisal has been made, 
the following steps should be completed to insure the legal transfer of collections 
and guarantee that proper processing guidelines are followed so that collections
 are properly arranged and available in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>General Steps in Processing Personal Papers or Organizational Records</strong></p>
1.	Record each acquisition in the collection management system or using an accession record sheet.  This 
form should provide all administrative and legal information regarding newly 
acquired collections.  The accession record sheets should be entered into the 
collections database on a regular basis.  (See <a href="#appendixb">Appendix B</a> 
for citations to all sample forms and work sheets discussed.)
<p>2.	Develop a preliminary biographical sketch or administrative history of the 
creator of the collection.  Identify the focus of work either by subject or chronology 
and include key individuals who influenced their work.  Identify family or 
organization members when possible.  Cite sources of biographical information from 
texts like biography and genealogy master indices.  This is only a brief 
preliminary sketch, 
as you will likely discover additional information when processing the collection.
<p>3.	Conduct a preliminary inventory by reviewing the collection.  Identify the 
order and organization of materials filed in the existing boxes.  Do not rearrange 
the collection at this time.  Identify the general types of materials in the 
collection.  Are they primarily about the individual or organization's work?  
Are the materials retrievable in their present order?  If so, identify the basic order.
<p>4.	Discuss the collection's arrangement or lack of order with the appropriate 
supervisor.  Reorganize the collection as needed.  If there is no discernible 
order to the collection, organize the materials to the folder level according to 
series categories and continue to discuss with the appropriate staff member.
<p>5.	Rebox and refolder the collection.  Pay particular attention to who the 
correspondence is with, the subject of correspondence or writing, and additional 
information that can be added to the finding aid.  
Remove metal paper clips, staples, and other non-archival quality items.  Remove 
and set aside duplicates.  When appropriate, place acid free paper before and 
after previously joined items to indicate that documents are together.
<p>6.	Prepare a preliminary scope and content statement for the collection.  
Based on knowledge of the individual's or organization's work identify items of 
research value, what is unique, and what is not available which you might expect 
to find in the collection.
<p>7.	Prepare a written finding aid for the collection describing materials to the 
folder level within each series.  Use your preliminary work sheets to complete the 
guide. Sample finding aids are available  in <a href="#appendixc">Appendix C</a>.

<a NAME="provenance"></a><h4>Accessioning and Processing Manual
<br />Part 1: Provenance and Accessioning</h4>
<p><a href="#table">Back to table of contents</a>
<p>The concept of provenance is integral for the processing of archival and manuscript 
collections.  The features of the term are best described through the following 
three-part definition.</p>
1. The "office of origin" of records, i.e., the office or administrative 
entity that created, received, and accumulated the records in the conduct of its 
business.  This can also cover the person, family, firm, or other source of personal 
papers and manuscript collections.
<p>2. Information of successive transfers of ownership and custody of a particular 
manuscript.</p>
<p>3. In archival theory, the principle that archives of a given records creator 
must not be intermingled with those of other records creators.
<p>In practice, the principle of provenance directly influences a number of basic 
processing techniques.  One of the more direct effects concerns the sanctity of 
original order.  If the papers being processed follow an obvious filing arrangement 
such as alphabetical, chronological, or by subject, then under the principle of 
provenance that arrangement should be maintained.  If, as is often the case, there 
is only a partial or incomplete arrangement, then it is up to the processor to 
determine the most appropriate arrangement system.</p>
<p>Another aspect of provenance concerns the intermingling of materials.  It is 
not acceptable practice to remove materials from a collection and add them to another 
collection because they initially appear to relate better.  Each collection is an 
individual entity and adding materials from another collection would tamper with 
its uniqueness.</p>
<p>The theory of provenance also dictates the determination of the body, institution, 
or individual that is the original owner and creator of the records.  This is 
particularly true in the processing of archival materials.  It is necessary to 
know who the creator or creators of the records were and what functions or activities 
they were involved with in order to determine how the records will be arranged.  
For example, if the creator was a business, how was it originally organized?  
What were the various departments and offices that together comprised the whole?  
If the creator was an individual, do the papers reflect the person's various 
interests such as business papers, personal correspondence, family materials, 
and other distinct types of records?</p>
<p>Accessioning refers to the process of transferring records to the custody of 
an archival repository.  Once potential donors have made a decision to place 
materials in a repository, the archivists must complete the legal and physical 
transfer of the records.  Legal title to donated records is conveyed by a deed 
of gift, also known as a memorandum of agreement.  The purpose of the deed of gift 
is to transfer legal title to the repository, detail conditions regarding the 
acquisition, how it is to be preserved, and terms of access.</p>
<p>When a collection arrives an accession record should be completed with 
as much information as possible.  A thorough accession record includes as much 
information about the collection, its condition, and the donor as possible.  
After physically taking control of materials the collection is immediately assigned 
an accession number based on the repository's numeric system.  
The date the materials were received, the name of the collection they will be 
housed in, and where they are stored should also be noted.  Contact information 
for the donor includes a telephone number, Web site URL, e-mail address, and postal 
address.  If the materials came from an organization, contact information for the 
individual responsible for transferring ownership such as the president or 
administrative assistant should be included in addition to the organization's 
general information.  When accepting new accessions the condition of the materials 
should also be noted.  This includes the actual amount of materials received, a 
brief description of the materials, any restrictions to access, as well as any 
physical problems such as a moldy smell, water damage, or disappearing print. 
The information is entered into the collection database as soon as is practical to allow 
for better management of the Department's collections.  Once the deed of gift is signed and 
the physical transfer of the records has taken place, the actual processing of 
the collection may begin.</p>

<a NAME="processing"></a><h4>Accessioning and Processing Manual
<br />Part 2: Processing</h4>
<p><a href="#table">Back to table of contents</a>
<p>Once a collection has been accessioned, the processor should research the 
history of the individual or organization responsible for depositing the records.  
The next step for the processor is to complete a preliminary inventory.  The 
preliminary inventory will provide a general overview of the collection by taking 
note of the types of material in each box and whether there is any discernible 
arrangement of those materials.  The preliminary inventory should not be a 
comprehensive record of the collection, but rather the product of an initial 
examination by the processor.</p>
<p>After the completion of the preliminary inventory, the actual processing of 
the collection begins.  A first step is to approximate the series within a collection.  
Series are generally arranged either by form, such as correspondence, photographs, 
and publications, or distinct activities, such as politics, environmental conservation, 
and fraternal organizations.  The processor may also implement a combination of 
the two forms or another system for series descriptions. Discuss your series schemes 
with a staff member before settling on any system. Once the sketch of the series 
in a collection is determined, the actual processing may begin.</p>
<p>There are a number of common procedures important in the physical processing 
of a collection:</p>
<p>1. Unfold and place materials in acid-free folders.  Carefully flatten items 
subjected to excessive or long-term folding. Consult a staff member if the materials 
require humidifying or other conservation measures.</p>
<p>2. Place acidic paper items between sheets of acid-free paper to protect 
the surrounding materials and/or photocopy the item onto acid-free paper.  
Consult a staff member when faced with preservation issues for further assistance.</p>
<p>3. Retain envelopes containing correspondence if they include extensive information 
not included in the letter or are unique in some way.  Copy the information from the 
postmark using a pencil if the actual correspondence is not dated.</p>
4. Remove staples and metal paper clips when necessary.
<p>5. Photocopy news clippings that are not part of a series of news publication 
issues onto acid-free paper.</p>
<p>While processing, an immediate question arising concerns the material's 
arrangement.  If the provenance is clear and there is a visible arrangement 
scheme, then follow that method.  If there is no clear arrangement, the processor 
should use the system that best fits the series, whether it is alphabetical, 
chronological, or by subject.  It would not be unusual for a collection to have 
a different arrangement in each of its series.  It is important to use the arrangement 
that best reflects the intent and content of the series.  Avoid using an arrangement 
scheme more elaborate than the material warrants and base arrangement decisions on 
the size, importance, and projected uses of the materials.</p>
<p>Some general guidelines to remember when arranging a collection include the 
following:</p>
<p>1. Retain all enclosures included with correspondence and keep incoming, 
outgoing, and ancillary correspondence together if this was the original arrangement.</p>
<p>2. Place undated material at the end of a chronological series.  If an approximate 
date can be determined, place the material at the end of the folder covering that date.</p>
<p>3. In an alphabetical series, place a folder covering a specific name behind 
the general alphabetical listing.  For example, if folder 1 is Aa-Az, then folder 
2 would hold Andrews, Mark.</p>
<p>4. Put inclusive dates on folders when possible, indicate if undated materials 
are a part of the folder, and use circa dating when it is possible to make such a determination.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult decisions while processing concern the disposal of 
items of dubious value.  Although a collection's main task is to preserve records 
of value, many valuable collections contain material of questionable worth.  The 
inclusion of such material in a collection can be a waste of space and time for 
both the processor and future researchers. Throughout the appraisal and 
organization of a collection, the processor must determine 
whether records have primary, secondary, administrative, fiscal, legal, 
historical, evidential, informational, research, or intrinsic value. Consult one 
of the glossaries of archival terms in <a href="#appendixa">Appendix A</a> for 
further information about each of these values.</p>
<p>The following guidelines are offered as a way to standardize and rationalize 
disposal techniques.  These are not unbreakable rules, but should be considered 
flexible guidelines for disposable materials.  Always remember to discuss any 
questions you may have with the appropriate staff member.</p>
<p>1. Remove more than two duplicates of most materials from the collection.  
Frequent exceptions to this are publications, photographs, and audiovisual materials.</p>
<p>2. Canceled checks, receipts, bills, bank statements, and insurance policies 
are often prime candidates for disposal.</p>
<p>3. Common and multiple blank forms are generally weeded from a collection.</p>

<a NAME="composing"></a><h4>Accessioning and Processing Manual
<br />Part 3: Composing the Finding Aid and Cataloging Record</h4>
<p><a href="#table">Back to table of contents</a>
<p>The finding aid is the processor's link with the researcher and the Department's staff.  It describes 
the content of the collection and its arrangement to the researcher.  The finding 
aid produced by the processor establishes physical and intellectual control over 
records or archival materials.  The basic components include the title and 
introductory page, table of contents, administrative history or biographical 
sketch, scope and content note, series description, and box and folder list.  
A finding aid template is available for processors in the Department  
and examples are available in <a href="#appendixc">Appendix C</a>. Citations to work sheets 
for the biographical sketch, administrative history, scope and content note, 
and series description are available in <a href="#appendixb">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>The title page should include the full name of the collection and its inclusive 
dates (and bulk daates if relevant) followed by the author of the finding aid's name and date of completion.  
If more than one person worked on the finding aid or if the current version is a 
revision of an earlier finding aid or inventory include that information as well.  
The title page also includes basic departmental information, which can be found on 
the template.  The introductory page includes the size of the collection in cubic 
feet, how and when the collection was acquired, any access restrictions to the 
collection, and a copyright statement.  The table of contents should list each 
section of the finding aid and include series and sub-series titles.</p>
<p>The first narrative section of the finding aid is the biographical sketch of 
the individual or family or the administrative history of an organization or 
institution.  The purpose of this section is to provide the researcher with significant 
mileposts in the individual or organization's history.  Include name changes, noteworthy 
accomplishments, and particular areas of interest in this section of the finding aid.  
For individuals and families be sure to incorporate family relationships as well as 
information about ancestors and descendants.  Descriptions of organizations or 
institutions benefit from details about the mission of the group, administrative 
units, members, and relationships with similar or related organizations.</p>
<p>The scope and content note follows the biographical sketch or administrative 
history.  It is an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the collection.  
It should not be a compilation of the series description.  The scope and contents 
note includes a description of the types of records in the collection as well as 
references to any particularly noteworthy items in the collection such as correspondence 
from prominent individuals.  Also, be sure to relate the collection's contents to 
other related holdings in the Department of Special Collections and Archives.  
Identify any other institutions holding collections of the same individual or 
organization.</p>
<p>The last narrative component of the finding aid is the series description.  
This section discusses each series and subseries in the collection.  It includes 
the series title and inclusive dates, arrangement, the types of records found in the series, 
and prominent topics in the collection.  The series description should  
explain the arrangement of each series, so that researchers are able to understand 
how records were arranged and why.</p>
<p>The final section of most finding aids is the box and folder list.  The collection 
should be arranged by series and subseries with a folder-by-folder title list 
including dates.  Finding aids are made available to the public in paper form 
in the research room and electronically through the Department's Web site.  An 
HTML template is available that allows the user to simply insert text from a 
finding aid into the properly encoded document. Examples of finding aids 
marked up in HTML are available in <a href="#appendixd">Appendix D</a>.  Remember 
that each collection has its own unique character and requirements, so do consult 
the appropriate staff member with your questions.</p>
<p>Every processed collection in the Department also has a bibliographic record 
loaded in the Library's online 
catalog and WorldCat, OCLC's catalog of books, archival collections, Web 
resources, and other material worldwide.  The bibliographic record is produced using 
information taken from the finding aid and then inserted 
into a template created specifically for the Department's cataloging needs.  All 
bibliographic records include basic elements such as the author or creator of the 
collection, title, type of materials in the collection, subject headings based 
on the Library of Congress classification system, as well as summaries of the 
biographical sketch or administrative history, scope and content note, and 
series descriptions.  Each element has a designated field in the record.  The 
record should include as many subject headings as the collection necessitates 
based on its size and scope.  Relevant terms can be found in the Library of Congress 
subject headings reference texts, but it is also useful to search the Library's 
online catalog for items with related subjects and use those subject headings.  
Any individuals or organizations that created materials in the collection who were 
not listed as the author should also be included in the appropriate field.  See 
<a href="#appendixe">Appendix E</a> for samples of completed bibliographic records produced 
 to describe collections.  Additional information about cataloging manuscripts is 
also available in the Department through a manual produced to meet the Department's 
manuscript cataloging needs.</p>
