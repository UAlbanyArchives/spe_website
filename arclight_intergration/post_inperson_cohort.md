##In-Person Cohort Sessions

	The In-Person Cohort sessions, which took place from February 5th-7th 2025, provided an opportunity for eight members of the Remote Cohort Sessions to join the Project Team on campus at the University at Albany and spend three days brainstorming and writing a conceptual model. Participants came from as far as California and Canada to work on this incredible document and we are supremely grateful for their attendance.

	Though the Remote Cohort Sessions gave us the opportunity to “meet” each other virtually, the in-person sessions allowed for more bonding, a better understanding of each other’s experiences and viewpoints, and the opportunity to explore minute details instead of the broader generalizations from the remote sessions. There were a few prompted sessions on the beginning of the first day, but a majority of each day was spent in working meetings as problems were listed and groups formed to address them. Several options were explored including a specification sheet, position papers, use cases, and elevator pitches before finally coming together to write a draft conceptual model.

	This conceptual model intended to integrate digital objects in archival description was named the Delivering Archives and Digital Objects: a Conceptual Model (DadoCM). The more technical members of the In-Person Cohort worked to create specification guidelines that determined the scope, goals, properties, and implementation examples. They also created a diagram which shows a single connection between an archival component and its digital object record. Another group worked to define what fields must be linked between an archival component and Digital Object Record resulting in a diagram showing this connection. The last group worked to write explanatory passages, derived from the elevator pitch and position paper exercises, to describe how the model worked, the core principles, and the advantages and challenges for both archivists, technologists, and users.

	After much discussion, María a. Matienzo was the one to come up with the acronym “Dado” for the conceptual model, basing it on the woodworking “dado” which is a slot or channel cut across the grain of wood that allows another piece to be joined by sliding it into the groove. For our purposes, the conceptual model created the groove that allowed digital objects to slide into archival integration to join them.

	The In-Person Cohort Sessions ended with a community dialog which invited local archivists and students at the University at Albany to learn about the ArcLight Integration Project and provide reactions to the work done that week by the cohort. It was originally supposed to be on Thursday, but inclement weather forced us to reschedule. We were excited to speak with archivists from the New York State Archives and Union College as well as teaching faculty and students from the archives graduate program at UAlbany.

	Following the In-Person Cohort Session, the Project Team worked to review the materials created and develop it into a comprehensive document that highlighted the efforts of both the Remote and In-Person Cohort Sessions. After just over a month and several internal reviews, the now 30 page document was sent back to the In-Person Cohort so they may see the edits made and ensure that no points were diluted or incorrectly edited in the effort to expand upon the ideas determined previously.

	After receiving wonderfully helpful feedback from our In-Person Cohort, the Project Team worked to implement as much of the comments as possible. The DadoCM model will be shared with the Remote Cohort next and following their review, a community call will be set up to share the model with a larger group of stakeholders and a more diverse group of possible users such as archivists and archival technologists.
