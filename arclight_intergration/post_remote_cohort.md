The ArcLight Integration Project has made a lot of progress! Beginning with Call for Participation for both the Remote and In-Person Cohort Sessions during the month of October 2024, we received more than double the required application forms. It was heartening to see so many archivists supporting the nature of our work and eager to add their voices. Our Project Team reviewed the submissions before asking twenty qualified and diverse participants to join us virtually from December 2nd through December 6th 2024.

Each Remote Cohort Session lasted 1.5 to 2 hours, in which we went through guided prompts to facilitate discussion and deeper thinking of the problems at hand. Prior to our meeting, we sent: 

* [Background Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UNkvaR7ymKzOyZ0RxSf9ZRQ-YDxLF9dl01BkLni1Isk/edit?usp=sharing) including information regarding the
	* [Portland Common Data Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UNkvaR7ymKzOyZ0RxSf9ZRQ-YDxLF9dl01BkLni1Isk/edit?usp=sharing)(PCDM), 
	* [Example Digital Objects](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/123aNtOp30rx8RUcnoWftfqRn-TAt8kibftfVp45Wjy4/edit?pli=1&slide=id.g3164a2e0163_1_7#slide=id.g3164a2e0163_1_7)(solicited from our community), 
	* [Exploring IIIF Manifests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzhGOlEuJs0coWnFvaBJgYUCKDHAyEum40TwnGnrz24/edit), 
	* Instructions to [Add a Manifest to Mirador](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CjeKwELrbVlzouoQnSA63mpzUXQgZVWLVgwbXYUQ26M/edit?usp=sharing)
	* [Digital Objects in ArchivesSpace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Og7x_FcSTlYWs14CZLwqlZoXv10GYVPoXohixb2cct0/edit?usp=sharing), and 
	* A glossary of [Example Definitions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tm9GQhX_ffR-4Qt17_nSr8X5myvEzE0QTXTdkkaFDy4/edit?usp=sharing)

Recognizing that this was quite a bit of information to absorb before meeting, we asked our participants to familiarize themselves with the material, but advised that we would utilize and delve deeper in remote cohort sessions. 

Day 1 was intended to introduce the group members to one another as well as everyone to the problem that we would tackle over the course of the week. Our candidates represented a wide range of types of archives, from academic to community as well as a range of roles within the archives including research specialists, technical archivists, and those in leadership positions. The meetings were governed by an intentional participation agreement that prompted participants to invite, understand, and build on diverse perspectives. At the end of each day a survey was sent out to allow participants to gauge their comfortability with the atmosphere as well as the material, and the Project Team pivoted based on this feedback. We had two running documents that opened the first day and remained live throughout the week to serve as a central location to list Questions and Open Issues.

Text reads "Scope: Our scope is digital objects, including: Born-digital materials, Existing digitized collections, Fulfilling access via digitization; Connections: Archival description, Within digital objects (types of files, etc.)" class="img-fluid" />

Agendas were sent out at the beginning of each day, sometimes adjusted from feedback sent in via the Reflection Forms from the day before. There were several small presentations each day, both from the Project Team and those participants who had strong backgrounds on certain aspects, such as Maureen Callahan with archival description or Maria Matienzo with IIIF. Each day had at least one breakout session to allow dialogue between smaller groups that were facilitated by members of the Project Team and volunteer archivists from the University at Albany. Small group members were encouraged to nominate a reporter to explain their discussions to the large group in “come together” following the breakout groups.
	
Day 2 strived to encourage our participants to attempt to model the digital object examples that were sent out prior to the cohort session. We intended for participants to discover issues and opportunities by attempting to model digital object examples in line with archival description in ways that challenged our current understanding of digital object description. Recognizing that the conceptual model would not be written until the In-Person Cohort Sessions, these Remote Cohort discussions served to help identify issues and help to better understand the collective desires of archivists based on the sample that participated

<img src="/arclight_intergration/img/Day 2 Come Together Slide.jpg" alt="Slide from the second day of the remote cohort session. Text reads: "Come together: What is standing out to you? What are you doing again and again? What does that tell you? Are you following any consistent guidelines or rules? Are there any inconsistencies? Are there missing concepts or definitions? What is needed for archivists to do this work well?" class="img-fluid" />	
	
Pivoting after receiving feedback that more background explanation was needed, Day 3 used to explore the affordances and limits of IIIF. ArcLight Integration Project recommends IIIF for digital object access, but it is not a tool that a majority of participants were familiar with. Most of the session was spent explaining what IIIF is, how it connected to the Digital Object Examples, and then allowing our participants to ask questions anonymously using Poll Everywhere. Poll Everywhere allowed us to offer live polls that we could display in various graphs and designs to show participants that they were not alone in their questions.
	
Day 4 was used to review ideas that had been previously covered in more depth, specifically coverage and the concept of using the Digital Object Record as a bridge. Archivists have previously often only digitized part of a folder, how should we handle that? What is the digital object record, like a `<dao>`, and what is the digital object itself? Following presentations by the Project Team, we broke into smaller groups with the goal of attempting to define digital objects and digital object records. We debated which fields should be included in digital object models before coming back together to find similarities and differences. The second breakout session was used to imagine what a conceptual model based on our digital object definitions would look like.
	
December 6th was Day 5 and our final Remote Cohort Session. Our focus of the day was to recap what we had learned in the week, summarize the opportunities and barriers that had been teased out via the discussions, and better define what the next steps moving forward would look like. A “1-2-4-All” session was our first breakout of the day and involved self-reflection time, then discussion with one other partner, following this, pairs would be put in groups of four to talk about their conclusions before everyone came back together to discuss. Prompts for this exercise included looking at the barriers and risks to using archival methods to describe digital objects and how it would impact less-resourced repositories. The final activity was used to consider the Remote Cohort Session in general, prompted with the “4Ls Retrospective” which asked participants to think about what they liked, learned, lacked and longed for during the week. There we received amazing feedback that helped us to better plan our In-Person Cohort Session in February 2025.
