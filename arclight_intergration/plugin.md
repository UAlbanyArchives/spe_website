A major deliverable for the project will be an ArchivesSpace plugin that allows repositories to implement ArcLight alongside ArchivesSpace more easily. This would keep the ArchivesSpace staff interface for managing archival description, with ArcLight being used for public access like most [current implementations](https://arclight.sites.stanford.edu/arclight-implementations). Instead of scheduled exports overnight, archivists will be able to directly update description in ArcLight from the ArchivesSpace staff interface.

The plugin will also optionally parse IIIF manifests in the File Version field for ArchivesSpace Digital Object records. Just like `description_harvester`, this can add digital object metadata and full-text content to the ArcLight index so those objects can be discoverable alongside offline materials that must be requested.
