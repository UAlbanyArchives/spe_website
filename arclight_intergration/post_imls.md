In April, we received notice that our IMLS National Leadership Grant—which supports this work—was terminated by the IMLS acting director. If this decision stands, we will not be able to complete the project. Most critically, we will be unable to finish development of the ArchivesSpace plugin, a key component of our work that would allow archives to more easily implement ArcLight alongside ArchivesSpace and adopt [DadoCM]({{ site.url }}/arclight_integration/updates/dadocm)’s aggregate access methods more broadly.

While we are deeply disappointed, we want to draw attention to our colleagues at the IMLS, many of whom are currently on leave and face the threat of mass layoffs. The IMLS supports far more than individual grants—it is [foundational infrastructure for libraries and museums across the U.S.](https://ilovelibraries.org/article/what-does-imls-do-and-how-will-its-elimination-affect-you/), including state libraries and interlibrary loan systems that many rely on daily.

We encourage readers to follow [ALA recommendations in support of the IMLS](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/show-up-for-our-libraries).
