<p>Archivists know we need to make digital materials available quickly and meaningfully—but existing systems often require item-level metadata for every object—an unsustainable practice that only addresses portions of our collections. DadoCM is a minimal, system-agnostic framework designed to overcome this barrier. By integrating digital and physical collections through archival description, DadoCM supports aggregate description for digital objects, reduces duplicative metadata work, and unites archival discovery and delivery in a single interface.</p>

<p>Designed to be practical for repositories of all sizes, DadoCM empowers archivists to apply the same aggregate and extensible methods that work well for paper records to digital content. It’s designed to meet the needs of under-resourced institutions—many of whom are managing piles of digitized images on network shares or Google Drive and struggling to find a sustainable way to make those materials accessible and that effort more impactful.</p>

<p>The model supports a range of implementations—from simple links to files, to structured delivery using IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) manifests—enabling archivists to scale access efforts based on their capacity and infrastructure.</p>

<p>DadoCM complements existing systems like ArchivesSpace, IIIF-enabled repositories, and web archives. It focuses exclusively on access, not management or digital preservation, and identifies a small set of essential metadata elements to support responsible and interoperable delivery of digital content.</p>

<p>DadoCM emerged through a participatory development process, including a <a href="{{ site.url }}/arclight_integration/updates/remote_cohort">Remote Cohort in December 2024</a> that engaged in weekly structured exercises to surface community needs, and an <a href="{{ site.url }}/arclight_integration/updates/in-person_cohort">In-Person Cohort Working Meeting in Albany, NY in February 2025</a> that collaboratively drafted the model. This inclusive, community-driven approach ensured that DadoCM reflects a wide range of archival environments and real-world challenges.</p>

<p>We’re also planning an open online forum to discuss DadoCM at the end of June—details will be announced soon.</p>

<p>After the comment period, we’ll revise the model based on community input and publish it as a Markdown document, versioned in git and hosted on a static website for ongoing reference and updates.</p>

<p>Help us rethink how access to digital objects can work—join the conversation and share your thoughts on DadoCM!</p>
