ArcLight will rely on IIIF both for adding digital object content and metadata to a Solr index, as well as for serving digital object to users. This should not necessarily require a IIIF image server, just manifests and a webserver. Many IIIF features, such as multi-resolution support (zooming) would require an IIIF image server.

Implementers who plan to use a traditional digital repository may have IIIF support already built-in! This is how some of our Pilot Partners are planning their implementation. For a minimal implementation, there just has to be a feasible way of retrieving the IIIF manifest for an object from what you have in the File Version field in an ArchivesSpace Digital Object record.

Our deliverables will include an [ArcLight IIIF Specification]({{ site.url }}/arclight_integration/spec#arclight-iiif-specification) that clearly defines how to implement full-text OCR or transcription content within IIIF so that it can be consumed by description_harvester or the ArchivesSpace plugin for indexing into ArcLight. This will be based on established best practices in the IIIF community.

We will also provide documentation for installing a [IIIF viewer](https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/) within ArcLight for displaying digital objects.
