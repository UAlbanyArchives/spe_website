Weâ€™re excited to announce that a call for participation in the ArcLight Integration Project will be released in Fall 2024!

We will seek experienced practitioners with archival data expertise for both remote and in-person cohorts. Participants will shape key project specifications and receive honoraria for their contributions. Travel support will also be provided for those invited to join us in-person at the University at Albany, SUNY.

Stay tuned for more details and information on how to get involved!
