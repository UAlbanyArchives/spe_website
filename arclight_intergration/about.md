## Pilot Partners

To ensure this work meets the needs of a variety of institutions, we're working with a diverse set of archival repositories to set up pilot implementations with local data. All pilot partners are from either New York or Connecticut as they all participate in either EmpireADC or Connecticut’s Archives Online which are the only state-level Arclight instances currently in production.
