The ArcLight Integration Project is committed to providing a productive, inclusive and welcoming environment for discussion and collaboration about archival data structures. To support this and to further the goals of the project, we expect all participants to follow our Participation Agreement and Code of Conduct, including the project team, advisory board, and all participants.

The Participation Agreement outlines ways in which we encourage and expect each other to hold safe, engaging, and respectful discussions. The Code of Conduct outlines behaviors which will not be tolerated, how to report concerns or incidents, and how the code will be applied.

#### Participation Agreements

We expect all participants to agree to the following:

* To ensure only one person speaks at a time, and consider pausing to allow those who need more time to process or interject in conversation to do so.
* To make space and take space - encourage and yield the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group, and take space made for you as you’re able.
* To listen to and respect a person’s description of their experiences, including but not limited to those related to marginalization and discrimination.
* To recognize the interdependent nature of our work to support archival system design.
* To acknowledge that choices around practice, implementation, and technology vary widely and can be dependent on the availability of resources, and to respect our work as incremental.
* To provide a space where everyone can feel comfortable participating, even if they don’t use specific terminology or the perfect way to express their ideas or knowledge.
* To embrace curiosity and creativity, allowing for the opportunity to try new ideas, consider other perspectives, and establish new patterns.
* To use welcoming language (including a person’s pronouns) and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (“folks” or “y’all,” not “guys”).
* To give credit where it's due, and to uplift each other’s work and ideas.
* To accept critique and feedback graciously, and to offer it constructively.
* To seek concrete ways to make our physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible.
* To acknowledge the difference between intent and impact, and to look for ways to take responsibility for any negative impacts that we have.
* To be aware of time, respecting the commitment of all participants and the project team to accomplish the goals of this work.
* To take the moments that everyone needs to care for ourselves and their community, by paying attention to the needs of your body and mind, and to the welfare of those around us.

#### Code of Conduct

The ArcLight Integration Project seeks to provide participants with opportunities for collaboration that are free from all forms of harassment and are inclusive of all people. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, national or regional origin, body size, accent, race, age, religion, or other marginalized characteristics are inappropriate. Do not insult or put down other participants. Be careful in the words that you choose. Sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens or demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment. It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions that reinforce social structures of domination; sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); deliberate intimidation, stalking, following; threats or incitement of violence; photography or recording without clear permission; sustained disruption of presentations or discussion; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

##### Applying the Code of Conduct

All project participants — including the project team, facilitators, and participants — are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct in person, in online spaces, and while present in any groups of project participants inside or outside a formal project event. Participants violating the Code of Conduct will be warned and may be asked to leave an event, and in some cases, may be asked to no longer participate in the project. If you are being harassed, witness another participant being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Code of Conduct responder below.

##### Contacting Code of Conduct responders

The project team will gather multiple designated Code of Conduct responders who will be on hand to respond to Code of Conduct violations and assist in following the Community Agreements. The list of responders will be sent out to all participants prior to all cohort meetings. Responders will review Valerie Aurora's [Code of conduct first responder training](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/resources/code-of-conduct-book/). If you witness, suspect, or are the target of a violation of the Code of Conduct at an event, contact one of the people on the list.
