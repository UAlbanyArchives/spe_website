     <p>Note that style guides for published and unpublished material are provided by the University Libraries' <a href="http://library.albany.edu/reference/services/">Reference Services</a> at <a href="http://library.albany.edu/reference/style.html">http://library.albany.edu/reference/style.html</a>.</p>
	 
	 <p>Citations to published and unpublished materials acknowledge the intellecutal  
responsibility and rights to the materials and assist subsequent users to locate these materials. 
When citing unpublished materials, scholars should use the form of citation preferred for their discipline and 
include specific infomraiton to identify the unpublished material.  According to the 
<em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>
:
<blockquote>
Full identification of most unpublished material usually requires giving the title and the date of the item,
the series title (if applicable), name of the collection, and the name of the depository.
Except for placing the cited item first [in a note] there is no general agreement on sequence
of the remaining elements in the citation.[1]
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>
To further assist the reader, the box number and file name or folder number can be included in the citation.
Following these guidelines, sample initial footnote citations for items from the 
M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives follow.
</p>
