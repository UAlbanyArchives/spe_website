        Building roof renovation project from June to October, 2025
    </h5>
    <hr/>
<p>The Department of Special Collections & Archives Under Construction. Our building is undergoing a roof renovation project from June to October, 2025. Please read more on visiting and requesting materials. </p> 
<p>We are thrilled to announce that the Science Library (home to the Department of Special Collections, Archives and Preservation) is undergoing a much-needed roof replacement in Summer 2025! The building has faced significant water ingress problems in the past, with even minimal rainfall causing multiple leaks throughout the building. The roof renovation project will be pivotal in safeguarding the University’s archives and special collections. Furthermore, these initiatives will create a safer and more comfortable environment within the library for the campus community by facilitating study and granting access to research materials.</p>
<p>Throughout the construction period, the Special Collections & Archives will remain open and accessible to our users on an appointment only basis. The building will be safe to visit but it may be noisier than usual in our Reading Room, especially during the morning and early afternoon. Reference services and onsite research visits will be limited throughout this renovation project and require advance notice and detailed confirmation from departmental staff. Reproduction services will be available with an expected turnaround timeframe of four weeks due to limited access to storage areas during the renovation project.</p>
<p>Please reach out to the department using <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/web/reference/?visit" target="_blank">submit a request form</a> or call: (518) 437-3935, with any questions about our limited operations and research support.</p>  
  
<p>We are grateful for your understanding, patience, and support as we embark on this exciting journey to safeguard the University’s cherished and unique collections.</p>
