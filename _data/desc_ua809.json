            "The Albany Student Press (ASP) has been the name of the weekly student newspaper of the State University of New York at Albany (University at Albany, SUNY) since February 14, 1964 (Vol. L, no. 1). The ASP and its predecessors since 1916 have carried news of student events, opinion, organizations, and since the 1960s reviews of movies, recordings, and more recently, short literary pieces. The ASP is currently a weekly (while school is in session) publication, though for much of its existence (Fall, 1964 \u2013 Spring, 1996) it was published twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday. By the fall of 1996 the ASP was published only on Friday, and after the spring of 2003 the publication date shifted to Monday. The ASP is the successor to the briefly titled weekly student newspaper, the State University News, February 8, 1963 -- January 10, 1964, (Vol. XLIX, no. 2 \u2013 XLIX, no. 27). ",
            " The State University News and the Albany Student Press are the direct successors of the weekly State College News,, October 4, 1916 -- January 11, 1963 (Vol. 1, no. 1 \u2013 sic XXXIX, correctly [LXIX], no. 1). The State College News, was the first true (during the school year) student newspaper published at the then New York State College for Teachers. News of student life and events, faculty life and projects, and alumni news prior to 1916 was carried in the monthly The Normal College Echo, subsequently The Echo, from June 1892 \u2013 May-June, 1916 (Vol. 1, no. 1 \u2014 Vol. XXV, no. 9). The Normal College Echo and its successor, The Echo, were a combination literary magazine, student and alumni newspaper. After the creation of the State College News, in fall of 1916, The Echo remained the school\u2019s student literary magazine, and continued to carry faculty and alumni news until the creation of the Alumni Quarterly in 1919. The Echo also continued to carry some student news, particularly items of interest to alumni/ae, until 1919 when it became a strictly literary magazine."
