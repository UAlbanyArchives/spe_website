		<p><strong>Visitor Lot 2 is currently closed</strong> as of 3/17/2022 due to kiosk repairs. We suggest using Visitor Lot 1 or Visitor Lot 1A on Collins Circle or Visitor Lot 3 near the Podium West and Dutch Quad Faculty Staff Parking Lots. See the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/map/index.php">Campus Maps</a> page for directions.</p>

    <p>After exiting your car, go to the opposite end of the Visitor Parking Lot from the entrance, turn right and walk along Indigenous Drive toward the Science Library.  There will be a dorm on your left side that you will pass.  The Science Library will be the white building directly in front of you and to the left.  Enter two sets of doors and turn left to enter the atrium area.  Proceed fully into the atrium to the elevators in the back.  Take an elevator to the third level, turn right when you exit the elevator and then turn right again in the hallway.  The entrance to Special Collections will be directly ahead of you.</p>
