	<h3>Requesting an in-person appointment</h3>
</div>

<div class="col-12">

	<p>It remains our highest priority to protect the health of our staff and research community, therefore, kindly review the following information in advance of your appointment.</p>
	 
	<p><ul>
	<li>Our department is open for research by appointment only Monday-Friday from 9 am until 5 pm (the last available appointment time is 4 pm).</li>
	<li>Appointments must be requested at least 48 hours prior and by 4pm on Friday for the following Monday. Following your request, a staff member will contact you to confirm your appointment.</li>
	<li>We are currently accommodating four researchers at one time. Therefore, as a courtesy to our staff and your fellow researchers, please notify us if your plans change and you are unable to keep your appointment.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<h4>Before you arrive</h4>
</div>

<div class="col-12">
	<p><ul>
		<li><b>All individuals on campus, regardless of vaccination status, are required to wear a face mask inside all buildings</b> â€” unless the person is inside a private residence hall room, office, workspace with a proper barrier, workspace distanced at least six feet from any other occupied workspace, or other enclosed space where they are alone. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, must wear a face mask outdoors when they are unable to maintain six feet of physical distance from others (for example, while attending a gathering or sporting event). Anyone who is not yet fully vaccinated must wear a face mask outdoors at all times while on campus.</li>
		<li>Please monitor yourself for symptoms on the day of your appointment.  If you are experiencing symptoms or otherwise are concerned that you might be infected with the coronavirus or any other illness, we ask that you reschedule your appointment.</li>
		<li>No food or drink is allowed in the Department of Special Collections & Archives.</li>
