		 <h2>NOTICE<br />WARNING CONCERNING COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS [1]</h2>
</div>

<p>
The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of 
photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material.
</p>

<p>
Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized 
to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is 
that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than 
private study, scholarship or research." 
If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for 
purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may be liable for copyright infringement.
</p>

<p>
The institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, 
in its judgement, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of the copyright law.[2]

<h1 class="text-center">Citation Guide for Unpublished Materials</h1>


     <p>Note that style guides for published and unpublished material are provided by the University Libraries' <a href="http://library.albany.edu/reference/services/">Reference Services</a> at <a href="http://library.albany.edu/reference/style.html">http://library.albany.edu/reference/style.html</a>.</p>
	 
	 <p>Citations to published and unpublished materials acknowledge the intellecutal  
responsibility and rights to the materials and assist subsequent users to locate these materials. 
When citing unpublished materials, scholars should use the form of citation preferred for their discipline and 
include specific information to identify the unpublished material.  According to the 
<em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>:

<blockquote>
Full identification of most unpublished material usually requires giving the title and the date of the item,
the series title (if applicable), name of the collection, and the name of the depository.
Except for placing the cited item first [in a note] there is no general agreement on sequence
of the remaining elements in the citation.[1]
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
To further assist the reader, the box number and file name or folder number can be included in the citation.
Following these guidelines, sample initial footnote citations for items from the 
M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives follow.
