Primary source instruction is a great way to introduce students to research in archives and special collections. Archivists are ready to help you incorporate special collections materials into your classes. Use the [Instruction Request Form](https://albany.libwizard.com/f/instruction-request-archives) to schedule and coordinate your sessions with the Special Collections & Archives Department.  

Through active learning with our staff and primary source materials, students grow as researchers. Archivists are available to collaborate with instructors on creating a variety of learning experiences supported by our collections. 

While utilizing primary sources held in the Marcia J. Brown Reading Room, we seek to have students foster critical thinking and analytical skills and discover possible original research opportunities. 

The main goal of these teaching sessions focus on building students’ confidence with primary source literacy. If you have further questions regarding primary source literacy, be sure to take a further look at the [Guidelines for Primary Source Literacy](https://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/GuidelinesForPrimarySourceLiteracy-June2018.pdf) from the Rare Books and Manuscripts section of Association for College and Research Libraries and the Society of American Archivists. 

Our unique collections showcase various subjects including:
* [University History](https://archives.albany.edu/description/repositories/ua)
* [History of Capital Punishment in the United States](https://archives.albany.edu/description/repositories/ndpa)
* [Conservation and the Environment efforts in New York](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog?f%5baccess_subjects%5d%5b%5d=Conservation+and+the+Environment)
* [New York’s Labor History](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog?f%5baccess_subjects%5d%5b%5d=Labor)
* [History of the state of New York Politics](https://archives.albany.edu/description/repositories/apap)

In addition to leading instruction sessions, we are happy to work with instructors on assignments for their students or be a space for faculty to lead sessions using materials from our collections. 

If you are interested in bringing your class to the M.E. Grenander Special Collections & Archives, please fill out the [Instruction Request Form](https://albany.libwizard.com/f/instruction-request-archives). 

## Types of Instruction/Menu of Services 

### Instruction Sessions

* **Primary source orientation/introduction session/Archives 101 (in class, remote, or special collections space).** Sessions include basic information on what special collections offers, what special collections & archives are, handling and care of materials, policies and procedures, and how archival sources can be utilized for student research. We outfit all sessions to specific course needs or subjects at the instructor's discretion. We recommend an introductory session before scheduling hands-on workday sessions. Introduce or strengthen archival research skills with selections from our collections and other archives via digital collections. Topics include general terms and concepts, using sources and finding aids to identify relevant archival materials, and how to prepare for in-person visits to an archive or ask for remote reproductions. 
* **Interactive, active learning session (in Special Collections space).** In collaboration with the faculty, special collections staff selects course/topic/assignment appropriate materials for active, inquiry driven experiences.
	* **Single class sessions** that present archival or rare books research as a mode of discovery.
	* **Multiple sessions** (2 or more) that require return visits, students begin to undertake archival research and become comfortable and confident with concepts of research methodologies. Sessions are tailored as encounters and expose students to the iterative nature of archival research rather than only focusing on decontextualized primary source documents often at the center of show and tell archives 101 instruction sessions. Multiple sessions can encourage students to:
		* closely examine documents
		* observe, describe and reflect on what they have seen 
		* grapple with archival affect
		* practice critical analysis, interpretation, evaluation
		* begin the creative processes of telling stories, crafting original narratives and interpretations based on primary source materials. 

Introduction to Special Collections & Archives: Outlines the type of material held in our collections, how to navigate finding aids and requesting material in archival institutions. 

Primary Source Research: Focuses on practical research skills such as finding, accessing, and handling primary sources in a variety of formats. An interactive activity will introduce students to the process of researching using primary sources. Reviews collection biases in archives and how to use sources to develop both questions and arguments.   

Primary Source Analysis: For those already familiar with archives, we can include a close reading or visual analysis exercise using digitized archival sources and a worksheet to analyze and situate sources in their cultural, social, and historical context. Students will investigate primary sources through hypothesis, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, critical thinking, and evaluation. 

Behind the Curtain at Archival Repositories: Explores the roles of cultural heritage institutions, reviews basic archival concepts and how records are acquired, arranged and described. 

Subject-Specific Instruction: Our holdings cover a wide range of subject areas, and we love to showcase specific material from our collections that relate to your course topics! Explore our collections online, or email [speref@albany.libanswers.com](mailto:speref@albany.libanswers.com) to discuss how we can support the subject material of your class.

Bring your students to for a class visit. We offer two different types of class visits:

* **Department Led:** An orientation to Special Collections & Archives and includes basic care and handling, information on what we offer our users, what special collections & archives are, and how primary source, physical and digital materials can be utilized for research.
* **Faculty Led:** The faculty member will lead a class using items pulled from the Special Collections & Archives holdings.

### Research Consultations

Meet with an archivist one-on-one or as part of a course specific assignment to discuss finding and using material, specific collections overview, and research strategies.

### Instruction Consultations 

One on one virtual or in person meetings to discuss course planning, assignments, or collections suitable for class use. Contact the department at [speref@albany.libanswers.com](mailto:speref@albany.libanswers.com).

### Instruction Space

The Marcia J. Brown Reading Room can accommodate up to 25 students per session, on weekdays throughout the academic year. We can potentially make special arrangements for classes with large enrollments. 

Our class sessions are interactive, hands-on opportunities to look at different kinds of materials. Our class sessions seek to be inclusive, offering multiple perspectives, viewpoints, or lived experiences, but may not include every voice for a number of reasons, including bias in collecting practices. Let’s talk about the voices that aren’t represented and why. 

The background, experience, and knowledge you bring to this class session are valuable. There isn’t one right interpretation of a historical document. Please listen carefully and engage with everyone's responses respectfully. 

The material you encounter in this session has the potential to be uncomfortable or upsetting. Be kind to yourself and recognize your limits. You can look at something else or take a break. 

When working with primary sources, you may encounter racist, oppressive, or outdated language in the documents themselves or in the descriptions created by library workers. When we discuss these items, we will want to use terms that reflect the ways that people and communities describe themselves today. 

Discover, engage, and collaborate with Special Collections to help students use primary sources and understand material culture.
