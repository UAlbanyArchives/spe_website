        <p>The Department of Special Collections, Archives and Preservation is grateful for the generosity of our donors who support our ongoing collections use and care. If you have visited our department, attended a campus tour, or received research assistance from one of our archivists and would like to make a <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1642/18-giving/form.aspx?sid=1642&gid=2&pgid=2122&dids=8&sort=1">monetary donation</a> to support our work, thank you! Designate in the comments that the gift is for the Department of Special Collections or the Preservation Lab or please <a href="mailto:speref@albany.libanswers.com">contact us</a> for assistance.</p>
        <p>If you would like to donate unique manuscript and archival materials that enhance or complement our existing collections, please read the guidelines below first. We do not accept collections or records unsolicited or without an archivistâ€™s consultation.</p>
        <p>Our repository collects materials in <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/web/mission/">several areas</a> so potential donors should review these collecting areas to ascertain if the topic of the materials is an appropriate fit. If it is, donors should also review the instructions below to gather any necessary information for archivists and be mindful of items that are not suitable for archival donation. If you donated material in the past, you may not have answered these questions. Since collecting needs continue to evolve, we ask you to review this donor checklist now. </p>

        <p>The University Archives serves the University at Albany by ensuring permanent records are preserved for long term reference. </p>
        <p>The University Archives can accept any records defined as permanent retention under the <a href="https://www.suny.edu/sunypp/documents.cfm?doc_id=650">SUNY Retention Schedule</a> or the <a href="https://www.suny.edu/sunypp/documents.cfm?doc_id=650">New York General Retention Schedule.</a> The University Archives focuses on records that document the major policy-making or decision-making processes of the University. </p>
        <p>The University Archives does not collect faculty research materials or materials created by alumni after they have left the University. </p>
		<p>Paper records must be boxed with labeled folders and must come with a digital inventory of folders in DOCX, XLSX, or PDF.</p>

<p>Potential donors outside the University should only donate materials that are inactive, if you believe there may be a possible personal or organizational future use for any of the prospective materials then those materials or collections do not warrant donation at this time. <strong>In addition, as a public institution, all are welcome to view and use collections in our repository. Do not donate any sensitive materials that you may be uncomfortable with being available for public consumption.</strong></p>
<p>If you believe you have material that is a potential fit for donation after reviewing all these guidelines, then <a href="mailto:speref@albany.libanswers.com">contact us</a> to begin a conversation and begin to determine if we are the correct repository for your collection. </p>
