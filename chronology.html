				<h2>Chronological History of the University at Albany, SUNY, 1844-2008</h2>
				<h4>by Geoffrey P. Williams, <i>University Archivist Emeritus</i></h4>
			</div>
			<hr/>
			
<p>The chronology is a work in progress undergoing continuous revision as new or 
more accurate information becomes available. For example, it has been commonly 
thought that the earliest known mention of the school colors, purple and gold, 
dated from 1907. The author recently discovered a reference to purple and gold 
as the school colors dating from 1896 and updated the chronology to reflect that 
change. It is essential that you consult the online Chronological History when 
confirming a date to make sure you have the most up-to-date information available. 
Currently, entries from 1844 through 1935 have been checked and updated 
for accuracy.  Entries without citations or followed by ???? means there is some
doubt as to the validity of the entry should be confirmed with Geoffrey 
Williams, University Archivist Emeritus. The chronology represents the author's 
personal view of what is important in the University's history based on 
questions received in the University Archives. The Chronological History is 
intended to give brief information about a subject and pointers to fuller 
sources of information. Any errors or omissions are the responsibility of the 
author.</p>
<p><b>Using the Chronological History: </b> Most 19th Century entries are simply 
listed in chronological order during the year they occured. As the entries 
become more numerous, the entries for each year are divided into sub-categories, 
again listed in chronological order when an exact date is known. Among the 
sub-catagories are: Academic Colleges, Departments &amp; Schools; Academic 
Degrees and Certificates; Academic Programs; Administration; Centers &amp; 
Institutes; General; Gifts; Grants; Alumni Affairs; and Student Life.</p>
<p><b>Searching 
the Chronology: </b>You can search by decade or use the Edit command and Find.  
Simple one word searches work best. Example: If you are interested in David Page, 
just search Page.  You may get a few extra hits but you will also find buildings
named after Page long after his death.</p> 
<p><b>Other Histories: </b> Readers who want a fuller history of the University 
should consult the three major published histories of the school: Kendall Birr, 
<I>A Tradition of Excellence: The Sesquicentennial History of the University at 
Albany, State University of New York, 1844 to 1994</I> (Virginia Beach, VA: The 
Donning Company, 1994); William Marshall French and Florence Smith French, 
<I>College of the Empire State, A Centennial History of the New York State

<I>The Liberal Arts in the Curricula for the Preparation of Teachers at the State 
University of New York at Albany, 1844-1966</I> (The University of Connecticut, 
1967), or an excellent unpublished history: W. Paul Vogt, <I>The State 
University of New York at Albany, 1844-1984, A Short History</I> (c. State 
University of New York at Albany, 1984). Copies of these works, along with a 
number of other specialized histories, are held in the M. E. Grenander

<H2>Founding in 1844</H2>
<H3>1844</H3>

  <p><B>May 7th</B>--The State Normal School created by legislature to train 
  teachers for the Common Schools of N. Y. S. It was the 4th state normal school 
  in the country, the first in N. Y. S., and the first outside of 
  Massachusetts.&nbsp; The school was financed by a $9,600.00 grant from the 
  Literature Fund for the first year and $10,000.00 per year for the following 
  five years.&nbsp; It was regarded as an experiment which could be canceled in 
  the future.&nbsp; The State Normal School remained the only "State" normal 
  school in N.Y. till 1866 when the N. Y. S. took over the municipal normal 
  school at Oswego.&nbsp; The State Normal School was under the joint control of 
  the Secretary of State and the Regents. (William Marshall French &amp; 
  Florence Smith French, <I>College of the Empire State: A Centennial History of 
  the New York State College for Teachers at Albany</I> [Albany, NY, 1944], pp. 
  38, 45, 72, hereafter cited as French.&nbsp; A photograph of the original

  Rev. Dr. Alonzo Potter, and Rev. William H. Campbell (State Normal School at 
  Albany. Executive Committee Minutes (transcription), Vol. I, p.1, hereafter

  </p>
  <p><B>December 18</B>--The first classes were held at the State Normal 
  School's temporary building, former Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railway Building, 
  later known as Van Vechten Hall, located at 115-121 State Street. The 
  building’s second and third floors were donated by City of Albany rent free 
  for five years. The City also donated $500.00 to renovate the building. Van 
  Vechten Hall was demolished in the early nineteen-sixties for construction of 
  the IBM Building. The initial enrollment was 29 students taught by two 
  faculty: David Page and George R. Perkins.&nbsp; By the end of the session 98 
  students were in attendance, "an equal number from each sex".&nbsp; State 
  students, those nominated by County Superintendents, receive free tuition and 
  a $.03 pre-mile travel allowance from their home paid at the end of the term.&nbsp; 
	Sixty-nine "State Pupils" were registered by the end of the 1st term.&nbsp; State 
	students also received a weekly room &amp; board allowance, $1.25 for women, 
	$1.00 for men.&nbsp; (French, pp. 53-54, 59; Figures on students from French and

<H3>1848</H3>

  <p><B>January 1</B>--Principal David Page dies. Page Hall on the Downtown 
  Campus was named for Principal Page in 1929.&nbsp; Among Page’s achievements 
  were designing a curriculum that remained largely unchanged until 1890, 
  securing the support of the legislature for the new experiment in teacher 
  training, and securing legislation that allowed every recipient of a Normal 
  School diploma to teach in the State of New York. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, Jan. 
  1, 1848, Vol. 1, p. 70; French, p. 92) </p>
  <p><B>January 12</B>--George R. Perkins, LL.D., the first faculty member hired

  <p><B>April</B>--Governor John Young approves the Act of the Legislature 
  passed April 12, 1848 titled "An act for the permanent establishment of the 
  Normal School" and the sum of $15,000 for the building of a permanent Normal 
  School building at corner of Lodge and Howard Streets. The City of Albany 
  donates the old fire house on the corner.&nbsp; The following year the State 
  appropriated another $10,000.00 to complete the building and a further 
  $3,500.00 for furnishings.&nbsp; The main entrance of the building faced Lodge 
  Street. (<I>Annual Report of Executive Committee, Feb. 11, 1850</I>, p. 9) See 
  the <I>Annual Report of the Executive Committee, 1850</I> for a print of the 
  new building by Richard H. Pease, the floor plans, as well as a description
  of the design of the building for the building. George J. Penchard of firm of 
	Perkins &amp; Penchard, was the architect, . (Exec. Comm. Minutes, March 28, 
  1848, Vol. 1, p. 83) &nbsp; For the exact location of the building see <I>Map 
  of the City of Albany with Villages of Greenbush, East Albany</I>, &amp; Bath.

  Records.)</p>

<H3>1849</H3>

  <p><b>April 11</b>--By act of the Legislature "Every teacher shall be deemed a 
  qualified teacher who shall have in possession a diploma of the State Normal 
  school." (<I>Annual Register and Circular of the State Normal School, Albany, 
  N. Y., for the year ending July 31, 1851</I>, p. 37, Appendix A of the Annual 
  Report of the Executive Committee of the State Normal School to the 
  Legislature, in Senate, No. 34, January 12, 1852) </p>
  <p><B>July 31</B>--The Normal School moves to new permanent building at the 
  Corner of Lodge &amp; Howard Streets.&nbsp; (<I>Ann. Rpt. Exec. Comm., April 
  12, 1852</I>, p. 3; French, pp. 93-94).&nbsp; This building was occupied by 
  the School until 1885.&nbsp; It was demolished in 1949. (<I>Alumni 
  Quarterly</I>, Jan. 1949, p. 2) </p>
  <p><B>September 26</B>--The Association of Graduates of the New York State 
  Normal School was formed by William Phelps, SNS ’45, supervisor of the 
  Practice School, 1845-52, Silas Bowen, SNS '45, Teacher of Intellectual 
  Philosophy, 1845-53, and William W. Clark, ‘45, Teacher of Natural Philosophy 
  and Chemistry, 1845-51.&nbsp; The Association is the direct predecessor of 
  current Alumni Association. The Association, lead by Corresponding Secretary 
  William Phelps ‘45, maintains a record of the address and profession of 
  graduates.&nbsp; Phelps set up an educational placement bureau for the Normal 
  School through the Association of Graduates. The Association’s members were 
  also seen as a ginger group to give political support the Executive 
  Committee’s plans for the Normal School.&nbsp; The Association meets 
  biannually. With Phelps’ departure in 1852 the Association lost its driving 
  force and appeared by be primarily a mechanism for organizing reunions. 
  Reunions were held in 1851, 1853, 1857, 1859.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reunions were 
  canceled during the Civil War and not very successfully renewed in the late 
  sixties. They were held in 1867, 1868, 1870, and 1872.&nbsp; (For the founding 
  of the Association of Graduates see the <I>Annual Report of the Executive 
  Committee of the State Normal School to the Assembly, Jan. 3, 1850</I>, pp.

  in the second of three fall terms.&nbsp; No subsequent “Programme” mentions 
  Calisthenics during the 19th Century. In the April of 1861 “military drill” 
  was added to the gymnastic exercises for men. Military drill was lauded in the 
  1862 <I>Annual Report</I> for “important points of superiority over 
  gymnastics.&nbsp; Its effect on the carriage, its tendency to produce a habit 
  of subordination, and its power to create the highest precision and promptness

  the college be restricted to “methods of teaching, school economy, philosophy 
  and history of education, and such other matters as are properly and directly 
  connected with the science and art of teaching.” A final resolution granted 
  the school the right to grant bachelors, masters and doctor of Pedagogy

  <p><B>December 14</B>--Andrew S. Draper/Edward J. Goodwin Plan is enacted by

  for teacher training. The Draper/Goodwin Plan directed that the College 
  discontinue all training for the elementary schools, institute admissions 
  requirements “substantially the same as those laid down by other eastern 
  colleges of good standing,” establish a “four year course in the liberal arts 
  and pedagogics,” require students “to pursue such subjects of study as are 
  deemed essential to a liberal education,” require “professional 
  courses...fundamental to the training of teachers ... of every student,” 
  institute elective courses, mandated that the school’s mission was to train 
  teachers for “secondary schools, training schools and normal schools” and 
  train instructors in “art, manual training, domestic economy, commercial 
  branches and other special subjects.” The Draper/Goodwin Plan granted the 
  school the right to offer B.A., B.S., and Pd.B, “the first two to be given on 
  the satisfactory completion of a four-year course, the third conferred only 
  upon college graduates after a year of post graduate study.” The plan was 
  formally instituted with the class entering in September 1906. (“Plan of 
  Reorganization,” New York State Normal College, Albany, <I>Circular and 
  Announcement of the Courses of Instruction 1906-1907</I>, p. 6-7) The State 
  Normal College was the only institution in the state to provide free liberal 
  arts degree. It was reputedly the first former Normal School in the country to 
  offer liberal arts degree for teachers. <i>(Need to check the last claim!!)</i>

	the state with their teachers learning about local history, the "I Have A 
	Dream" program which guarantees college tuition to 94 Albany students, the 
	Scholars Recognition Program, honoring senior scholars and teachers.  CASDA

	State University of New York on February 16, 1961.  This document (p. 49)

	areas of the State.  Graduate centers, each of which will offer programs through
	the doctorate level, should be established in the following locations: 1. Stony
	Brook-Setauket, 2. Binghamton, 3. Albany, 4. Buffalo."  The document went on 
	to describe development of each graduate center.  The "Graduate Center in Albany" 
	was described (p. 50)in the following terms: 
	"Coincident with the early development of graduate programs in the natural 
	sciences in the Long Island Center, the multi-purpose college in Albany should 
	begin graduate work in the humanities and social sciences.  The introduction 
	of master's level work in these subject areas should be effected immediately.  
	Because of its traditional commitment to the arts and sciences and the presence 
	of strong teaching departments, the only factor which should initially limit 
	the introduction of master's programs is the availability of appropriate space.
	Programs in the humanities and social sciences at the doctoral level should be 
	developed as early as possible. Utilizing the resources of the State Library, 
	modest beginnings at this level might feasibly be made now.  A doctoral program
	of appropriate dimensions, however, must await the relocation and expansion of 
	the College on its new site." (<i>State University of New York The Master Plan

  of the idea for Human Awareness Potential Day, and by implication the turning 
  on of the campus fountains as a major event. (Arron Smith, "Human Awareness
