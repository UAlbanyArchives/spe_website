<h4>
	A. Introduction</h4>
<p>The principal purpose of The M. E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives is to collect, preserve, provide access to, exhibit, and encourage research use of the University Libraries&#39; unique manuscript and archival materials, the official records of the University, rare books, and printed materials. These materials are acquired by gift or purchase and serve the current and future research interests of faculty, students, and others affiliated with the University as well as other qualified researchers from the region and beyond.</p>

<h4>
	1. The German and Jewish Intellectual &Eacute;migr&eacute; Collection</h4></div>
<p>The German and Jewish Intellectual &Eacute;migr&eacute; Collection was established to preserve the personal papers and related research materials of German-speaking intellectuals who came to the United States after 1933 from Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe. The emphasis is on building discrete collections of original manuscripts.</p>
<p><b>Languages:</b> German, English, French<br />
	<b>Geographic Areas:</b> United States, Germany<br />
	<b>Chronological Periods:</b> 1890 - present</p>
<p><b>Scope:</b> The collecting areas include: Personal papers of former members of the University in Exile, now the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science of the New School University in New York City.</p>
<p>Personal papers of &eacute;migr&eacute; social scientists (economists, sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists), humanists (historians, philosophers, art historians, and musicologists), writers (novelists, poets, journalists, and political writers), and artists (musical performers and graphic artists).</p>
<p>Personal papers of &eacute;migr&eacute; intellectuals, especially those whose lives, thoughts, and works relate directly to the experience of refugees from Nazi Germany and to the political and social movements of that era (national socialism, the German youth movement, etc.).</p>
<p>Records of organizations founded to assist or further the interests of &eacute;migr&eacute;s.</p>
<p>Selective acquisition of published works by &Eacute;migr&eacute;s.</p>
<p><b>Types of Materials Collected:</b> correspondence; journals, memoirs, diaries, and notebooks; manuscripts of published and unpublished works; biographical materials; copies of books and offprints of their articles; notes, drafts, and galley proofs; writings&#39; lectures, and speeches; subject files; minutes/reports; brochures and flyers legal documents; professional papers; photographs, prints and drawings; ephemera, genealogical information, and clippings with information about the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, their lives, times and professional interests; and sound recordings and moving images.</p>
<p><b>Types of Materials Excluded:</b> routine financial records (invoices, cancelled checks, etc.); artifacts (plaques, statues, etc.), the research value of which is insufficient to compensate for problems of space and storage; and entire libraries of &eacute;migr&eacute;s, since only a small percentage of the books will be retained either for the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives or, subject to subject librarian review, for the general circulating collection of the University Libraries.</p>

<h4>
	3. University Archives</h4></div>
<p>Non-current records of the University at Albany (including all offices, departments, and divisions of the University and its predecessor institutions) are appraised and selectively accessioned for permanent preservation in University Archives because of their lasting administrative, legal, historical, or research value. The University Archives also selectively accessions records of student organizations and other records created by students during their time at the University that offer substantive documentary evidence of student life. (Note that non-permanent, inactive University records are not part of the University Archives and are managed by the creating University office).</p>
<p><b>Languages:</b> English<br />
	<b>Geographic Areas:</b> New York, primarily Albany<br />
	<b>Chronological Periods:</b> 1844 - present</p>
<p><b>Scope:</b> Since the University Archives were established in 1971, the following types of records have been deemed to have permanent value: University records required to be preserved permanently according to the Records Retention and Disposition Schedule of the State University of New York.</p>
<p>Minutes and other policy-making records of University governing bodies, committees, offices and departments, institutes, and research centers.</p>
<p>Administrative records of enduring value relating to management and planning, instruction, students, personnel, finances, athletics, plant, alumni activities, and research at the University.</p>

	4. Miriam Snow Mathes Historical Children&#39;s Literature Collection</h4></div>
<p>The focus of the Miriam Snow Mathes Historical Children&#39;s Literature Collection is on books and periodicals for children and young adults, published in the United States between 1875 and 1950. In order to illustrate the history of children&#39;s literature, the collection also includes a representative selection of American and British children&#39;s books (1501-1874.)</p>
<p><b>Languages:</b> English, French, Russian<br />
	<b>Geographic Areas:</b> United States<br />
	<b>Chronological Periods:</b> 1850 - 1960</p>
<p><b>Scope:</b> The collecting areas include: MATRIX materials, an extensive gathering of obscure and forgotten works that formed the bulk of publishing for children. This is the first priority for acquisitions. Although the Mathes Collection will never include a majority of all the works published in any of the periods covered, the goal is to have enough of this matrix material to provide (a) a fuller documentary context for the historical and critical study of children&#39;s literature, and (b) valuable supplementary documentation for research in social and cultural history. Since children&#39;s literature is not written by children, the style and content of this material reflects, by what it offers and what it suppresses, the hopes, fears, values and biases of the adults who were writing, publishing and disseminating literature for children in the Anglo-American tradition. Many of the run-of-the-mill materials in this category (e.g., toy books or miscellanies or series books) were once widely marketed and more widely read than most or much of the material in the next two categories.</p>
<p>Works by REPRESENTATIVE authors from the periods covered. These works, which fall into a second priority category, are the ones that are often included in syllabi and reading lists covering the history of children&#39;s literature. They include works which were once widely known but are usually not in children&#39;s libraries today-although their authors or titles or main characters may still be alluded to (e.g., <i>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress</i>, <i>Goody Two Shoes</i>, <i>Sandford and Merton</i>, Peter Parley books, Horatio Alger books, Pollyanana, Tom Swift, Uncle Wiggily, etc.). Also included in this category are obsolete kinds of literature that are considered to be typical of certain eras (e.g., chapbooks, dialogues, religious tract publications, Sunday school books, words-of-one-syllable editions, etc.).</p>
<p>Editions of the CLASSICS of children&#39;s literature. Since these texts are still available in many libraries, this is a third priority category. In this category, emphasis is placed on providing subsequent, variant and adapted editions before 1950.</p>
<p><b>Types of Materials Collected:</b> Published books.</p>

<h4>
	3. Security Collection</h4>
<p>The Department maintains a collection of books solely for security reasons, rather than because of their age, rarity, or exceptional monetary or artifactual value. These books are recommended for transfer to Special Collections by the subject librarians and accepted by the Head of Special Collections and Archives, contingent upon the availability of space.</p>
<p>Examples of books transferred for security reasons are oversized art books with tipped-in color plates and pictorial publications prone to mutilation, and books in certain &quot;high-theft&quot; subject areas such as erotica and photography. Books in these areas are reviewed periodically and returned to the circulating collection if no longer considered to be in &quot;high-theft&quot; subject areas. Books are not stored in Special Collections if they can be accommodated on Reserve. It should be noted that brittle and severely damaged books -- if they have no artifactual value but the subject librarians wish to save their intellectual content -- are referred to the University Libraries&#39; Preservation Office for repair or reformatting. Some materials transferred to or initially placed in Special Collections for security reasons circulate while other materials do not. The subject librarian makes a circulation decision at the time of the transfer.</p>
