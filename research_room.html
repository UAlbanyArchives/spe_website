<p>Marcia Brown, B.A. New York State College for Teachers Class of 1940, was an internationally renowned illustrator and author of children&#39;s books. Ms. Brown was awarded the Caldecott Medal, the American Library Association&#39;s highest award for excellence in childrens&#39; picture-book illustrations, for three of her books: <i>Cinderella, or the Little Glass Slipper</i> (1954); <i>Once a Mouse</i> (1961); and <i>Shadow </i>(1982), and six more of her books were Caldecott Honor Books. Marcia Brown&#39;s career as a published illustrator began in 1937 when she joined the art staff of <i>The State Lion</i>, the New York State College for Teachers student humor magazine. Her formal career as a children&#39;s illustrator, author, and translator began with the publication of <i>The Little Carousel</i> in 1946. That book, which she wrote and illustrated, was followed by over thirty more during her career.</p>
<p>To honor Ms. Brown&#39;s intellectual and financial support of the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives, the University Council voted unanimously to name the Department&#39;s research room in her honor. On November 2, 2001, The Marcia Brown Research Room was officially designated.</p>
<p>Ms. Brown named the University Libraries as the repository of her life&#39;s work, including her correspondence, manuscripts, drawings, final art, books, and puppets. The <a href="https://archives.albany.edu/collections/catalog/mss005">collection page for the papers of Marcia Brown</a> is available online and includes a detailed description of the collection as well as a more robust biographical sketch. The Spring 1996 issue of <em>Albany Magazine</em> included a feature about Marcia Brown entitled <a href="http://www.albany.edu/feature/marcia_brown/index.html">&quot;Of Handsome Princes and Flying Elephants&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>A few examples of Marcia Brown&#39;s work are available online in the exhibits <em><a href="https://archives.albany.edu/catalog?f[collection_sim][]=Marcia+Brown+Papers">Images from the Marcia Brown Collection</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.albany.edu/museum/wwwmuseum/Brown/">Once Upon A Drawing: The Picture Book Illustrations of Marcia Brown</a>.</em></p>
