				<p>Since we are a publicly-funded university, we are subject to New York State public records laws, namely New York State Arts and Cultural Affairs Law Section 57.05. Specifically, SUNY has a Records Retention and Disposition Schedule which outlines how long we must keep different types of records before they may be thrown away or disposed of. Certain records must legally be preserved permanently.</p><p>The purpose having a plan for our records is to limit potential legal liability while at the same time ensuring that valuable records are kept to ensure openness and accountability.</p>

				<p>You can read the whole document <a href="https://www.suny.edu/sunypp/documents.cfm?doc_id=650">here</a>. Overall, it requires that, "In order to preserve records of historical and archival value, certain categories of records are to be retained permanently." It goes on to outline which types of records meet this distinction.</p><p>Basically, any record that "...documents a significant subject, or major policy-making or program-development process" must be kept permanently. <!--<a href="{{ site.url }}/ua/SUNYRecordsRetention">Here is a more detailed summary of what that means.</a>-->

				<p>We prefer to accept records in the native format in which they were created. Today that often means digital files on your computer, but you probably create paper records as well.

You should export a <span class="code">.pst</span> file of only that folder and then transfer that folder to the archives. <!--<a>Here are instructions on how to do this with Outlook.</a>-->

			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>Absolutely! The university website is a very complex and ever-changing record. We have been preserving the entire university website for a couple years now. We crawl and store most of it weekly, and some of the most prominent pages are crawled daily for recent updates.</p>
<p>Even if you put some of you records online through the university website, it still may be more effective to transfer these records directly to the archives. The reason for this is that digital records like <span class="code">pdf</span> files and Microsoft Office documents are easier to manage than our vast, sprawling web archive. Transferring records directly ensures that they are preserved in accordance with the <a href="https://www.suny.edu/sunypp/documents.cfm?doc_id=650">SUNY Public Records Laws</a>.</p>
